# JUMPER
INTRODUCING!! That one game you probably played as a kid in elementary but has now been retconned due to it being 'controversial'! Not to worry! We have come up with a new way to toy with our imaginative stick person! Forget the gallows, WE TAKE TO THE SKY!!

Jumper is played according to the following rules:
```
    -The puzzle is a secret word randomly chosen from a list.
    -The player guesses a letter in the puzzle.
    -If the guess is correct, the letter is revealed.
    -If the guess is incorrect, a line is cut on the player's parachute.
    -If the puzzle is solved the game is over.
    -If the player has no more parachute the game is over.
```
